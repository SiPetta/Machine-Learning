# MACHINE-LEARNING
The machine learning part of this capstone project is to create a machine learning model that can be used to predict whether a person has a sleep disorder or not.

## METHOD
Natural language processing (NLP)

## TOOLS
* Python
* TensorFlow
*
*

## DATASET
Here is the dataset that we used to build our model: 
* 

For this project, we reduce the variable so that we use:
* 

## HOW TO PREDICT
The model will predict the sleep disorder's presence through these factors:
*
